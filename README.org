#+title: Coral Lab Simulator

Provide a common API to many useful robotics libraries for simulation, motion
planning, and more.

Need a separate library for control.


* Robots

Robots have the following features:

- They can be added to any simulator
- They can be added to any motion planning environment
- They can be used to fill parameters for a motion planner

* Simulators

A simulator can be instantiated

1. pybullet
2. mujoco

* Motion Planning Env

A motion planning env mainly just provides a collision checker
function.

1. torch_robotics envs

* Motion Planners

1. mp_baselines
